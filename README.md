# Writer portfolio site - dorianwilczynski.pl

My first serious project - a portfolio site for an fantasy author. Simple, vanilla design. It features a custom news sorting and a working PHP contact form. As this was my first project, every part of it was somewhat of a challenge, but at the same time, a great learning opportunity.
