# Writer portfolio site - dorianwilczynski.pl

My first serious project - a portfolio site for an fantasy author. Simple, vanilla design. It features a custom news sorting and a working PHP contact form. As this was my first project, every part of it was somewhat of a challenge, but at the same time, a great learning opportunity.

## About

This project was made entirely from scratch, without any external libraries. The aim was to hone my front-end development skills, while at the same time creating something useful in the real world for a real person (in this case - a family member). Because I was really new to web development when I started to work on the site, I had to face various challenges and come up with my own solutions on the fly. Of course, extensive googling was necessary, as well as a lot of fixing, refactoring and changing. In the end I am happy that I managed to complete the project, even though I realize it is by no means perfect.

### Main features
* custom fullpage carousel as the "hero section"
* news sorting system - displays news in sets of 3 per page, regardless of the actual number. Of course there is no CMS so adding content is only available via hardcoding it in HTML
* projects section in the form of one block, split into two parts - titles list and project view
* contact form with HTML validation, handled by simple PHP code (found online & adapted - I don't know much about PHP)
* fluid typography - font sizes based on viewport height & width
* responsive
